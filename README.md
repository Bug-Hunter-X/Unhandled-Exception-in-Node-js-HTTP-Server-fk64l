# Node.js Unhandled Exception Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: unhandled exceptions in HTTP servers.  The `bug.js` file shows an HTTP server that throws an exception but lacks proper error handling. This leads to the server crashing. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with error handling.
